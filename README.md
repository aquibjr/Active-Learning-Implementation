# Active-Learning-Implementation

This was part of my assignment for the course Machine Learning in BITS Pilani.

The goal was to implement various active learning algorithms without actually using a dedicated active learning library. For testing, I have used the wine dataset within sklearn. I have also used sklearn for the various models required. 

The following Algorithms have been implemented in both stream-based and pool-based approaches:-

1. Uncertainty Sampling - Least Confident, Margin, Entropy
2. Query by Committee - Entropy, KL Divergence
3. Diversity Sampling
