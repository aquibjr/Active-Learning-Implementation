# Active-Learning-Implementation

This was part of my assignment for the course Machine Learning in BITS Pilani.

The goal was to implement various active learning algorithms without actually using a dedicated active learning library. For testing, I have used the wine dataset within sklearn. I have also used sklearn for the various models required. 

The following Algorithms have been implemented in both stream-based and pool-based approaches:-

1. Uncertainty Sampling
    1.1 Least Confident
    1.2 Margin
    1.3 Entropy
2. Query by Committee
    2.1 Entropy
    2.2 KL Divergence
3. Diversity Sampling
